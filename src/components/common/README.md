# Documentation 

The form was at first made up of the oakta widget doc that they provided. It had great design and drop downs. It looked like it worked but it didn't have the functionality for the backend. We had to scrap that and make the form kinda from scratch to make it work for the back end. It still kept some of the style but not the drop downs. But the most important thing was to make sure everything worked.
