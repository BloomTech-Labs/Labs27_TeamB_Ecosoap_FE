# Documentation 

In this home container I made the layout to both the administrator page and the buyer page. I made a mock up form by using the widget they provided. It looked great but wasn't fully functional until we got the endpoints. The state was a difficult thing to pass with the widget so we decided to do it another way. Was able to style the page and display the profile information on the administrator page.
