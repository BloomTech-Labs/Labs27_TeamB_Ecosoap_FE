When first coming to the login page you will notice a drop down that has a toggle that you can switch from buyer to admin. Once you enter you will see the landing page. If you log in as a buyer you are able to see that it has an order form as well as a very stylish navigation bar. We are able to log out. The form is fully functional and is connected to the backend team. Due to time constraints, we would love to display on the buyer page the confirmation status of the order. We were able to post in console logs but not get it to display on the screen. On the admin page we have the user information display on the page. Again, due to time constraints we weren't able to display the order form from the buyer side to the admin side.
